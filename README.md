Hi there!
I'm a Master's student in Data Analytics at Northeastern University, passionate about programming, data algorithms and machine learning.

With a strong foundation in Python and proficiency in SQL, Java, and C++, I'm confident in my ability to analyze, manipulate and interpret data. I've honed my creative thinking and problem-solving skills, making me well-suited to tackle complex challenges in the data science field.

Aspiring to be a data scientist, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to further my knowledge and experience. I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and contribute to meaningful data-driven solutions.

Let's connect and see how we can work together!
